TODO -- try using Jekyll instead of a template.


I found this template from this list of "20 Professional HTML & CSS Resume Templates": https://templateflip.com/html-resume-templates/



See "Ceevee" for more details about the template I used: https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/ceevee/


https://www.styleshout.com/ has more free templates worth checking out.



Ceevee is a clean, modern, fully responsive site template for your resume and portfolio.
