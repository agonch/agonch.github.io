TODO -- try using Jekyll instead of a template.

Currently, I copied from this template: https://www.themezy.com/free-website-templates/151-ceevee-free-responsive-website-template



See "Ceevee" for more details here: https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/ceevee/



Ceevee is a clean, modern, fully responsive site template for your resume and portfolio.
